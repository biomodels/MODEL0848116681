# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Rate dependence and regulation of action potential and calcium transient in a canine cardiac ventricular cell model.**   
Hund TJ, Rudy Y. _Circulation_ 2004 Nov 16;110(20):3168-74

**Abstract:**   
BACKGROUND: Computational biology is a powerful tool for elucidating
arrhythmogenic mechanisms at the cellular level, where complex interactions
between ionic processes determine behavior. A novel theoretical model of the
canine ventricular epicardial action potential and calcium cycling was
developed and used to investigate ionic mechanisms underlying Ca2+ transient
(CaT) and action potential duration (APD) rate dependence. METHODS AND
RESULTS: The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) regulatory
pathway was integrated into the model, which included a novel Ca2+-release
formulation, Ca2+ subspace, dynamic chloride handling, and formulations for
major ion currents based on canine ventricular data. Decreasing pacing cycle
length from 8000 to 300 ms shortened APD primarily because of I(Ca(L))
reduction, with additional contributions from I(to1), I(NaK), and late I(Na).
CaT amplitude increased as cycle length decreased from 8000 to 500 ms. This
positive rate-dependent property depended on CaMKII activity. CONCLUSIONS:
CaMKII is an important determinant of the rate dependence of CaT but not of
APD, which depends on ion-channel kinetics. The model of CaMKII regulation may
serve as a paradigm for modeling effects of other regulatory pathways on cell
function.
